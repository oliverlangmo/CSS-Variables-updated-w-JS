## Using CSS variables and updating them with JavaScript

This is from #JavaScript30 by Wes Bos

First we set the CSS variables on the :root element in the css sheet. Then we create the variables using the --variableName: value; format. Then we use the variables to style the image and .hl class. Finally we use vanilla JavaScript to change the variables based on user input.
